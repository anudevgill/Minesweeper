Pseudocode:

START program
BUILD a 10 by 10 board
BUILD all the variables needed for the program
FOR 10 times
    GENERATE a random integer between 0 and 9 for the row number
    GENERATE a random integer between 0 and 9 for the column number
    ADD the [row, col] pair to 2D array mines which contains the locations of all the mines
WHILE unHit and guessCounter < (100 - number of mines)
    GET the coordinates of the player's click
    IF the click is legal
        ADD the coordinates of the player's click to 2D array clickTracker
        INCREMENT guessCounter
        LOOP through the mines array
            IF the coordinates of the user's click match the position of a mine
                REVEAL all the mines
                SET unHit = false
                PRINT a losing message saying that it took guessCounter tries until the player hit a mine
            ELSE
                COUNT the number of adjacent squares that contain a mine
                PLACE a peg with this number at the location of the player's click
    ELSE
        PRINT a message telling the user their click was invalid
IF guessCounter == 100 - number of mines
    PRINT a winning message saying that it took guessCounter tries for the player to clear the board
    REVEAL all the mines
END program
